`make` is a tool responsible for **generating binary and other non-source
files** of a program from the program's source.

`make` can be used to compile source code of **any language**.

### Features

- _enables user to build and install_ software without knowing the details of
  that specific software
- _compiles source files as needed_. can relate to _**hot-reloading**_.
- `make` is also capable of _installing and uninstalling_ packages.

A _Makefile_ contains **instructions** for `make` to run. A series of
instructions are known as **a rule**. A Makefile also describes relationship
among files.Example of a simple _rule_:

```makefile
target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …
```

- **target** is usually the **name of the file** that is generated by a program.
This file generally is an executable or object file.
A target can also be the **name of an action** to carry out, sucj as `clean`.
- **prerequisite** is a file that is used as input to create _target_.
- **recipe** is an action `make` caries out.

> `make` uses tab for _**indentation**_. Failing to use it would throw an _*error*_
