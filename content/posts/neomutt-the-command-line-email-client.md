Mutt is a command line email client which can connect to IMAP/POP3 and SMTP
protocols as well as read emails from local directories.

So, how do I stumbled upon it? I am trying to optimize my workflow. Having to
click around a GUI-based email client isn't my thing. So, I look for
alternatives.

Why Mutt? because Mutt features a keybinding which is similar to Vim. This
means, a single set of shortcuts would work pretty much [everywhere](#). 
Although I am using NeoMutt, things are pretty much same in both.


> All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less.

Here I am going to document how I set-up Mutt from Scratch!

## Install

Mutt and NeoMutt is available in official repositories of most of the Linux
distribution. I am using Arch Linux, so I just needed to run 
`sudo pacman -Syu neomutt`. You don't need to install additional packages to
get Mutt working.

One more thing, I am using NeoMutt to get access to some extra features Mutt
does not provide by default. There is not much differences in UI and
functionalities.
